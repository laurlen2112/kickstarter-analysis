# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The aim of this project is to utilize data from Kickstarter to demonstrate to a client, Louise, the performance of various campaigns with respect to their launch dates and fundraising objectives.


## Analysis and Challenges



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

[Deliverable 1](https://github.com/laurlen2112/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) displays successful and failed campaigns within the parent category of "theater," organized by month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

[Deliverable 2](https://github.com/laurlen2112/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) analyzes successful and failed campaigns with respect to their fundraising goals, specifically focusing on data within the "play" subcategory. The fundraising goals are divided into brackets, separated by approximately $5000 each, as depicted in the accompanying picture.

## Results

**Conclusions drawn from outcomes based on launch date data:**

From the data in "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date," the first conclusion that can be drawn is that May and June are typically successful launch months. Specifically, May had 111 successful launches and 52 failed launches, while June had 100 successful launches and 49 failed launches. Based on this data, launching a campaign in May or June has approximately a 66% chance of success and a 32% chance of failure. The second conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that December is not an optimal launch month. The statistics indicate that December had only 37 successful launches and 35 failed launches, resulting in an almost equal chance of success or failure for new launches during that month, at approximately 50%. 

**Conclusions drawn about the outcomes based on goals data**

The data suggests that campaigns with lower fundraising goals tend to have higher success rates compared to those with higher goals. For instance, campaigns with goals below $1000 have a success rate of 76%, while those with goals above $50,000 have a success rate of only 13%. Additionally, campaigns falling within the $15,000 to $19,999 goal range have an equal probability of success or failure, at approximately 50%.

**Limitations of this dataset**

Deliverable 1's dataset is limited in that it does not provide detailed information regarding which types of launches are successful and which ones are not. While the parent category of "theater" is included, it does not include subcategories such as plays or musicals. If these subcategories were incorporated into the Deliverable 1 pivot table, we could identify the optimal launch months and campaign types.

Similarly, Deliverable 2's dataset is limited as it solely focuses on the subcategory of "plays." There may be other theater subcategories that demonstrate success in higher goal brackets. Therefore, comparing the various subcategories and their outcomes based on fundraising goals could assist Louise in selecting the ideal subcategory for her next launch.

**Other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created**

To improve the analysis, it would be beneficial to add a subcategory column to Deliverable 1's pivot table to compare the success levels of each subcategory per month. Similarly, modifying Deliverable 2's table to include successes and failures by subcategory would enable Louise to gather more specific information and make a more informed decision for her next campaign.

Moreover, creating an additional table that breaks down the fundraising goal ranges in Deliverable 2 into smaller increments, such as $2500, could help Louise identify the highest goal range with the best probability of success. Although this may result in a more complicated table with more data, it would provide Louise with more information on the $15,000 to $19,000 range, which currently has a 50% chance of success or failure. By analyzing this range in more detail, Louise may be able to select a higher fundraising goal that also has a high likelihood of success.
