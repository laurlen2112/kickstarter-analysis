# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to utilize the Kickstarter data to show Louise how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch date and fund raising goals.


## Analysis and Challenges



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

[Deliverable 1](https://github.com/laurlen2112/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)shows successful and failed campaigns in the “theater” parent category by month. 
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Deliverable 2 shows successful and failed campaigns in relation to its fundraising goal.  This deliverable examines data in the “play” subcategory.  The goal range is broken up into brackets separated by about $5000.00 each bracket (picture).


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I encountered difficulty with the “countifs” function.  To use the formula, I searched for information on “countifs” and applied those processes to the Excel.  My initial chart departed from the example in the module.  By chatting with a classmate, I realized that I forgot to include the “greater than”(>) symbol in the formula which skewed the table. Once I corrected the formula, the chart matched the example in the module.

## Results

**Two conclusions drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch Date data**


The first conclusion that can be drawn from “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” data is that May and June tend to be successful launch months.  May has 111 successful launches and 52 failed launches.  June has 100 successful launches and 49 failed launches.  Based on this data, a launch in May or June has about a 66% chance of success and about a 32% possibiity of failure. The second conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that December is not an ideal launch month.  The data indicates that December has only 37 successful launches and 35 failed launches.  Since the successful launches and failed launches in December are almost equal, a new launch in that month has about a 50% probability of failure or success. 

**Conclusions drawn about the Outcomes based on Goals data**

This data demonstrates that campaigns with smaller goals tend be more successful than campaigns with larger goals.  Campaigns with goals under $1000.00 are 76% successful.  By contrast, campaigns with goals over $50,000 are only 13% percent successful.  The data also shows that campaigns within the goal bracket of $15,000 to $19,999 have a 50% chance of success or failure.


**Limitations of this dataset**

The dataset in Deliverable 1 is limited because it does not provide further information about what types of launches are successful and what types of launches are failures.  The theater parent category contains the subcategories of plays, musicals, and spaces.  If those subcategories were included in the Deliverable 1 pivot table we would be able to identify the best months to launch and the best type of campaign to launch.  The dataset in Deliverable 2 is limited because it only looks at the subcategory of “plays”.  The other theater subcategories may show success in higher goal brackets.  Therefore, comparing the various subcategories and their outcomes based on goal may influence Louise to choose her next launch based on one of the subcategories with a higher goal in mind.

**Other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created**

It is possible to a subcategory column to the Deliverable 1 pivot table to compare level of success or each subcategory per month.  Additionally, modifying the table on Deliverable 2 to include the successes or failures by subcategory will allow Louise to drill down on the information and make a better informed choice for her next campaign.  Finally, it may be helpful to make another table that reduces the goal ranges in Deliverable 2 so that each range is about $2500 in difference rather than $5000 in difference.  While it will complicate the table with more data it may provide Louise the ability to  identify the highest goal range with the best probability of success.  As mentioned above, the range of $15,000 to $19,000 has a 50% chance of failure or success.  It may benefit Louise to provide more data on that range so that she is able to choose a high goal with a high probability of success. 

Bar charts and pie charts may provide nice visualizations of this data.  For example, a bar chart showing successful and failed launches by month shows, at a glance, which months have the best chance for success.  Additionally, a pie chart of successful launches and a pie chart of failed launches so they can be compared side-by-side to determine the best probability for a successful launch.
